          <h2>Doing my research.</h2>
          <p>The Office of Undergraduate research allowed me to gain experience with Computer Science outside of the classroom. I was able to see
          the real world application of the topics I had exposure to in class. This helped me decide which route I wanted to take. My research mentors
          were very supportive. It was great to see faculty that were so passionate about their work.</p>

            <h3>CCS Data Scholars</h3>
            <p>During my Junior year, I interned at the University of Miami Center for Computational Science. I spent the semester making revisions and creating new
            activities for the <a href="https://ccs.miami.edu/ccs-data-scholars-summer-data-immersion-program-funded-by-the-childrens-trust/"> CCS Data Scholars program</a>.
            The Data Scholars program is a summer program that exposes middle and high school students to careers in Computational Science. The scholars
            develop their command-line skills while exercising their creativity through playing with geospatial, image, and text data. I strongly believe that early
            exposure is the key to bringing more students into tech. Working on this project was a step outside of my comfort zone. With the guidance of my mentor, I was able to
            conduct research on STEM education and learn how to manipulate data using R.</p>

            <h3>AAFA: Associative Affinity Factor Analysis for Bot Detection and Stance Classification in Twitter</h3>
            <p>My first research experience at UM was with the College of Computer Engineering. The goal was to build an automated system for bot detection using Associative
              Affinity Factor Analysis framework and automatically infer stance of users to see if they were a Clinton or Trump supporter. Through this research I was introduced to the
              concept of machine learning. I learned how to gather tweet data using the Twitter API to conduct bot detection and sentiment analysis. I used python to clean the data
              before feeding it to the classification models.
