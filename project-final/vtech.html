            <h2>GREAT THINGS HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE. </h2>
            <p>During the Summer 2017, I spent 9 weeks in Blacksburg, VA doing research at the Virginia Tech Biocomplexity Institute.
            I had the opportunity to expand on my budding interest in Data Science and learn about data visualization using Python. With guidance from my mentors, I was able to complete and present
            my research in front of Virginia Tech faculty and my peers. Along with the academic growth I experienced, I was able to make some lifelong friends by bonding over living in the middle of "nowhere". After working in our labs all day,
            we spent our free time having intern volleyball matches and taking weekend hiking trips to the mountains.</p>

            <h2>ASSESSING THE RESOLUTION OF INFLUENZA DATASETS IN THE UNITED STATES.</h2>
            <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQPZgV2YHj-Qe-fxbUX5Zb3NcCAg_qXolgj3-MUW5S8DJraNyI8yYa6LmtMjaIySvA814UIjCU7iACN/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
            <p>Disease surveillance networks around the United States are used to monitor disease spread in order to establish patterns of progression.
               Epidemiologists and public health officials use this data to detect the emergence of diseases, conduct outbreak investigations and manage epidemics.
               Influenza surveillance data that is both high resolution and high volume are lacking making it difficult to monitor transmission of the disease at a
               local level. However, having such a high resolution record of historical flu season will allow us to recreate them in simulations and aid in
               counterfactual studies.  We evaluate 3 historical datasets of varying spatial resolutions and volumes to assess influenza activity on a local (county)
               and regional scale: Medicaid Open Payments data, CDC ILINet data and DoD ILI data. From each of these datasets we attempt to extract weekly ILI (influenza-like-illness)
               counts during each flu season. We find that the Medicaid payments dataset does not contain enough influenza indicators to determine its spatial spread during past seasons.
              Comparing the weekly ILI counts of DoD data and CDC data at the level of HHS regions revealed a high temporal correlation. By considering the county level ILI counts at DoD
              facilities, we were able to compute emergence times for various counties per season. Plotting these allows us to visualize the spatio-temporal spread of Influenza for a given season.
              We believe that, integrating these varied datasets will allow epidemiologists to improve the fidelity and resolution of existing seasonal influenza models, in
              turn leading to better public health policies for its control and treatment.
