          <h2>MIA TO THE BAY.</h2>
          <p>During the summer of 2018, I spent 3 months in San Francisco after landing my first internship with my favorite social
          media app, Twitter. I applied for Twitter through the <a href="https://http://www.code2040.org">Code2040</a> Fellowship program. Through CODE2040, I was able to meet so many
          brilliant Black and Latinx engineers as well as recieve mentorship from engineers working in some of the top companies in the Bay
          area.</p>

            <p>The Code2040 fellows program consisted of weekly professional development workshops, retreats and panel discussions
            in which we were taught how to navigate the tech industry and thrive in our careers. As a result of this program, I now
            have a supportive group of friends that keep me motivated to achieve my professional goals.</p>

            <p>During my internship at Twitter, I spent 10 weeks working on the Database Infrastructure team. My project was
            to create a dashboard to allow teams to view the daily growth of their databases and to predict the size
            of their databases in the future. Monitoring the growth of a database is important because it
            allows teams to see when they may potentially run out of storage instead of it coming as a surprise. I used Python,
            MySQL, HTML/CSS and Javascript.</p>

          <div id="twitter-summary">
            <p>The best part about working at Twitter, aside from the endless amounts of free food, was the unique and diverse
              staff. I worked with a team that was from different parts of Asia and got the chance to experience their cultures. Twitter
              really emphasized open dialogue and the expression of your true self in the workplace. One of my favorite memories was seeing
              the Data Science manager DJing in the commons, blasting A$AP Ferg after I had just had a one-on-one with her a few minutes before.
              Every Friday employees were invited to gather after work and have a Q&A with the CEO's to discuss matters relating to the company.
              Nothing was off limits. The culture is unmatched. I couldn't think of a better place to start my career in tech.</p>
